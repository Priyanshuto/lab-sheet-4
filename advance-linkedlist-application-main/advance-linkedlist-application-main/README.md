# Linked List Implementations and Advanced Applications in Java

## Project Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of various types of linked lists including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Additionally, it includes applications such as a postfix calculator, a ticketing system simulation using queues, and a priority queue implementation.
